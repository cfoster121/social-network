This is an API for a social network that allows for creating users, creating thoughts, adding reactions to thoughts, and adding friends to users. 


## Getting Started

To use this app the user needs to run 'npm i' to install dependencies, 'npm run seed' if they wish to seed the data, and have MongoDB on their system.
